# flairLED-Arduino
This repo is controller code that can be used with most Arduino compatible boards to control RGB LED strips.
(NeoPixel, WS2811, WS2812B, ETC)

This code receives a color code over USB Serial, and sets the LED's to that.

You will have to modify this code yourself to be compatible with your controller and LED strip.

The source code is in `/src/` and can either be opened in [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/), or the Official Arduino IDE.
